# ScheduleTimer
A Timer that easily displays classes based on a schedule.

This is a cool timer that tells you when your next class is and how much time you have left until it starts. It's like having a personal assistant for your school schedule!

Here's how it works:

Fetches Your Schedule: First, the timer reads your school schedule from a json file called schedule.json. This way it can be easily changed without having to edit the html element of your code.

Calculates Next Class: Once it knows your schedule, the timer figures out which class you have next and how long until it starts.

Updates Every Second: The timer keeps checking the time and updating itself every second. To keep displaying the timer properly

That's it! It's super simple and helps you stay organized for your classes. Just open the timer, and it'll do the rest for you.

Enjoy using it!
